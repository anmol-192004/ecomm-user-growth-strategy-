# E-commerce User Growth & Monetization Strategy Simulation

##  Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world growth and monetization experiment for an e-commerce platform targeting Tier 2/3 Indian users. Using A/B testing, we measure the impact of personalized recommendations on engagement and revenue metrics.

##  Business Problem
How can personalized user experiences improve monetization and engagement in underserved Indian markets?

##  Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Excel (for A/B testing and analysis)
- GitHub (for deployment)

##  Simulated Experiment Setup
- 1,000 users randomly assigned to **Group A** (control) and **Group B** (personalized experience)
- Simulated orders, AOV, and engagement for each user
- Used real business metrics:
  - Engagement Rate
  - Total Orders
  - Average Order Value (AOV)
  - Total Spend

##  Key Insights
| Metric            | Group A | Group B |
|------------------|---------|---------|
| Engagement Rate  | ~68%    | ~80%    |
| Average AOV      | ₹120    | ₹132    | 

 Group B clearly outperforms Group A, showing that personalization strategies can uplift monetization and user activity in emerging markets.

##  Relevance to Business Analyst Role
This project replicates key responsibilities of a BA:
- Experimentation (A/B testing)
- Hypothesis validation
- Working with messy user data
- Drawing actionable insights from metrics
